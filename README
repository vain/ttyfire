Minimalistic client for 37signals' Campfire.


Create a ~/.ttyfire:

	your-companys-subdomain
	your.login.e-mail@example.invalid
	yourpassword
	highlight1;another highlight;highlight3
	Room 1
	Another Room
	Yet another room!


Dependencies:

	Python 2
	pyfire: https://github.com/mariano/pyfire
	GNU bash with readline support
	tmux
	Your terminal should support colors


TODOs:

	- Make the script pretty. It's a quick hack.
	- Manpages.
	- I'll add missing features once I need them.


"WTF?"

	ttyfire

	Launch a new tmux session for campfire or attach to an existing one.
	If there's no session yet, ttyfire will automatically join all
	channels defined in ~/.ttyfire -- the first four lines of that file
	are settings, all other lines contain channel names.


	ttyfire_new $room

	You have to create a new window inside a tmux session and launch
	another instance of ttyfire_new to join an additional channel.

	ttyfire_new must be run inside of tmux and creates two panes. The
	upper pane shows the output of campfire_room, the lower pane runs
	ttyfire_pipefiller.

	ttyfire_new binds "kill-window" on "^B F12" (or "^A F12" if you're
	using GNU screen bindings). This is the suggested way to leave a
	room. To leave all rooms, use "^B F1" which runs "ttyfire_quit".


	campfire_room $pipe_name $room_name

	campfire_room uses pyfire to connect to Campfire. The script joins
	exactly one room. campfire_room outputs anything directly to the
	terminal -- however, it reads commands from a named pipe. Anything
	you write to that pipe will be forwarded to the room, except for
	some special commands like "/users" and "/uploads".

	campfire_room rings the terminal bell on highlights. There is no
	support for libnotify or similar systems. Thus, you might want to
	"teach" your window manager and terminal to react properly on
	terminal bells.

	To help you highlight other people, you can start a message with
	"@mar,cas,and: hey, listen to me!" "mar", "cas" and "and" will be
	replaced with their full user names. Thus, the actual message might
	look like this: "@Marc Alaimo, @Casey Biggs, @Andrew Robinson: hey,
	listen to me!" To highlight all users, you can use "@ALL: ...".
	These shortcuts only apply to people who are currently in the
	channel.


	ttyfire_pipefiller $pipe_name

	ttyfire_pipefiller is a simple read-write-loop that reads from stdin
	and writes to the pipe.


	ttyfire_quit

	Kills all instances of "ttyfire_pipefiller" and sends a "/leave" to
	all open channels.


	ttyfire_resizer

	Periodically resizes all input panes to a fixed height. This may
	come in handy when you use a tiling window manager: If the terminal
	window gets resized, the tmux layout may be fscked up.
	ttyfire_resizer fixes this.


tl;dr

	- Create ~/.ttyfire.
	- Launch "ttyfire" in a terminal.
