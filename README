Minimalistic client for 37signals' Campfire.

Create a ~/.ttyfire:

	yoursubdomain
	your@login.exmpale
	yourpassword

Launch ttyfire:

	./ttyfire "Name of the room"

Best way to quit is to use "^A \". This key is bound to "kill-session".

Dependencies:

	Python 2
	pyfire https://github.com/mariano/pyfire
	GNU bash with readline support
	tmux
	Your terminal should support colors

TODOs:

	Make the script pretty. It's a quick hack.
