Minimalistic client for 37signals' Campfire.


Create a ~/.ttyfire:

	yoursubdomain
	your@login.exmpale
	yourpassword
	highlight1;another highlight;highlight3


Launch ttyfire:

	./ttyfire "Name of the room"

	Best way to quit is to use "^A \". This key is bound to
	"kill-session".


Dependencies:

	Python 2
	pyfire https://github.com/mariano/pyfire
	GNU bash with readline support
	tmux
	Your terminal should support colors


TODOs:

	- Make the script pretty. It's a quick hack.
	- I'll add missing features once I need them.


How it works:

	campfire_room $pipe_name $room_name

	campfire_room uses pyfire to connect to Campfire. The script joins
	exactly one room. campfire_room outputs anything directly to the
	terminal -- however, it reads commands from a named pipe. Anything
	you write to that pipe will be forwarded to the room, except for
	some special commands like "/users" and "/uploads".


	ttyfire_pipefiller $pipe_name

	ttyfire_pipefiller is a simple read-write-loop that reads from stdin
	and writes to the pipe.


	ttyfire $room_name

	The user frontend. It launches tmux and creates two panes. The upper
	pane shows the output of campfire_room, the lower pane runs
	ttyfire_pipefiller.

	Due to the fact that campfire_room can only join one channel, you
	need one terminal / tab per room.

	If another instance of ttyfire is already running for this room,
	then tmux will reattach to that session.
