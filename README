Minimalistic client for 37signals' Campfire.


Create a ~/.ttyfire:

	yoursubdomain
	your@login.exmpale
	yourpassword
	highlight1;another highlight;highlight3
	Room 1
	Another Room
	Yet another room!


Launch ttyfire:

	./ttyfire "Name of the room"

	Best way to quit is to use "^A \". This key is bound to
	"kill-session".


Dependencies:

	Python 2
	pyfire https://github.com/mariano/pyfire
	GNU bash with readline support
	tmux
	Your terminal should support colors


TODOs:

	- Make the script pretty. It's a quick hack.
	- I'll add missing features once I need them.


How it works:

	campfire_room $pipe_name $room_name

	campfire_room uses pyfire to connect to Campfire. The script joins
	exactly one room. campfire_room outputs anything directly to the
	terminal -- however, it reads commands from a named pipe. Anything
	you write to that pipe will be forwarded to the room, except for
	some special commands like "/users" and "/uploads".


	ttyfire_pipefiller $pipe_name

	ttyfire_pipefiller is a simple read-write-loop that reads from stdin
	and writes to the pipe.


	ttyfire

	Launch a new tmux session for campfire or attach to an existing one.
	If there's no session yet, ttyfire will automatically join all
	channels defined in ~/.ttyfire -- the first four lines of that file
	are settings, all other lines contain channel names.


	ttyfire_new $room

	The user frontend. It must be run inside of tmux and creates two
	panes. The upper pane shows the output of campfire_room, the lower
	pane runs ttyfire_pipefiller.

	Create a new tmux window and launch another instance of ttyfire_new
	to join an additional channel.
